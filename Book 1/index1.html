                        - 'You brought me back.' He inhaled to feel his lungs again. <br>
                        - 'I told you it was basically suicide.' <br>
                        - 'They know something. A lady said that this wasn't my battle or something. This is the first time it has ever felt so real.' <br>
                        - 'For everyone is different, detective.' She said as she gave him his badge and coat back. She then grabbed him by the shirt gently and whispered in his ear. <br>
                        - 'You don't believe it is real.' She then placed her hand on his heart. <br>
                        - 'You also lost my amulet.' <br>
                        The detective scanned the flat by just moving his eyes. <br>
                        - 'I didn't take it. If that's what you are thinking.' <br>
                        He kept quiet and kissed the enchantress on the cheek. 'Thank you,' He said, leaving it at that. <br>

                            In the vast emptiness a pair of giant floating fists shook in motion as if to play.
                            He picked the hand with the amulet's chain hanging out from it.
                            But there was nothing in this hand. 
                            He was prompted to pick again, but the other hand turned out to be empty as well.

                        - 'I can't win, can I?' <br>
                        - 'You already made up your mind, suspect and all.'<br>

                        A door appeared behind the familiar hands.
                        They reached for the handle, and the detective reluctantly stepped in.
                        He immediately recognised the flat, and went to check on his girlfriend straight away.
                        To his relief, she was sound asleep.<br>
                        - 'It is your chance to search the flat.'<br>
                        - 'It isn't here.'<br>
                        - 'And how do you know that?'<br>
                        - 'Because if it was, we wouldn't be able to enter. It is an amulet for protection. Take me back to where you tried to strangle me.'<br> <br>
                        He was back in the forest on a cold early morning.
                        Not knowing where to start looking, the hands opened to reveal that they had hidden the chain behind its palm all this time.<br>
                        - 'Oldest trick in the book.' <br> </p>

                    The hands said as they came closer and closer to reach for his neck again.
                    His 7 a.m. alarm went off, waking him up and putting him out of danger.
                    As soon as he remembered his dream, he put on his clothes to head to the enchantress's flat.
                    He let himself in with his copy of the key and went into her room, trying not to straddle as he sat on her bed to see if she was okay.
                    However, his shaky demeanour woke her up. He then proceeded to explain his dream to her without much hesitation.

                - 'I woke up in the early morning with this weird feeling that you went back to the forest without meâ€¦ Did you say that the witch has the amulet?'<br>
                - 'Yes.'<br>
                - 'That is why I didn't sense her. She is now capable of visiting us in our dreams without us necessarily knowing it. We will have to sleep together in the same bed. We will be safe as long as we share a bed together.'<br><br>
                The detective worked for Moons, but as his happiness with the enchantress grew, he felt he had to move on and marked Victor's disappearance unsolved.
                He had found a loving partner who kept him safe at night. The astral-projections were a thing of the past. He was a new man who had seen some weird things.<br><br>
                On a very hectic work day, he made a nest for his head with all his pending paperwork and accidently napping, he went back to that dreaded pagan forest.

                    He called the enchantress by name. But no matter how loud, she couldn't hear his cry for help. He desperately started looking for the amulet.
                    Time moved fast, and it was as if days had passed. With no hope of ever finding it, he laid on the grass for the 100th time. Then, a floating pair of cat eyes glared at him from the dark night sky. </p>
